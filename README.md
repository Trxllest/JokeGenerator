### Approach

I decided to generate jokes, because who doesn't like ot laugh?

The idea is to have it as simple as possible using the Yandex API.
- A joke is fetched on request by the user.
- The joke is provided in english by default.
- The user has the option to choose a langauge provided by Yandex and translate the current joke.

There was no need to add anything fancy because the idea is for someone to be 
able to quickly generate a joke and maybe save it for later. For instance on a date
or to break the ice at a job interview.
